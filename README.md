## What to Do
1. Accept the GitHub Classroom invitation.
2. Clone the repo that is created to your local machine.
3. `cd` into the directory that was created when you cloned the repo (it should be called `hw3-lm1k-<your-github-id>`).
4. execute `npm install`
5. Modify the code to allow todo items to be assigned priority and for the priority to be modified.
6. Push your final changes to GitHub before the deadline.
7. Create a screencast video and submit the link to Canvas before the deadline.
8. Indicate in your Canvas comments which requirements (including extra credit) you believe you met.
